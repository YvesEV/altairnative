    <p class="text-lg text-gray-400">Why We Need Alternatives to Everything—Even Intelligence Itself</p>
  </header>

  <main class="prose prose-invert prose-lg max-w-none">
    <p>We live in an era where intelligence has been productized—packaged in APIs, optimized for profit, and measured by performance on benchmarks no human ever agreed to. Artificial Intelligence, once a philosophical dream, is now an industrial toolset. Fast. Useful. Powerful. But is it <em>right</em>?</p>

    <p>At <strong>Altairnative</strong>, we are not building yet another model. We are building a question. A mirror. A counterweight.</p>

    <p><strong>We believe that intelligence isn’t a destination. It’s a direction.</strong> And sometimes, to find a better future, you need to look to a different star.</p>

    <p>That star is Altair—one of the brightest in the sky. And our mission is to create a space for <em>alt-AI</em>: intelligence that isn’t engineered just for scale, but for meaning. For ethics. For wonder. For rebellion against the flattening effect of mainstream thinking.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-10">What You’ll Find Here</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Essays on the future of AI, from cosmic to critical.</li>
      <li>Explorations of <em>“what if?”</em> AI—artistic, speculative, strange.</li>
      <li>Experimental tools that challenge how we think, not just how we compute.</li>
      <li>Voices from the edge of intelligence: philosophers, hackers, poets, and you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-10">Why We Exist</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Because the AI arms race has no finish line.</li>
      <li>Because ethics isn’t a plugin.</li>
      <li>Because the future deserves more than defaults.</li>
      <li>Because maybe, just maybe, there’s an alt-AI-rnative.</li>
    </ul>
